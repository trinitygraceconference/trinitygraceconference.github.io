<p itemprop="description">“God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.” John 4:24</p>

<p>“The first foundation of righteousness undoubtedly is the worship of God.” John Calvin</p>

<p>“To worship God in truth is to worship Him as He commands.” R. C. Sproul</p>

<p>This July, we will be exploring this theme, seeing how it is laid out in God’s word, examining how  our fathers in the faith engaged in worship and applying this teaching to our lives in the 21st  century.</p>

<p>The worship of God is the most fundamental thing we do as His people. Man was originally  created by God to bring Him glory in worship, and in Christ we are called out of the world, to live  as people who worship. God’s greatness demands that we worship Him, as prescribed by His  word. Worship is a great source of blessing to us, His people. The supreme expression of worship  is found when God’s people gather together in the name of Christ to worship God by the Spirit in  a Biblical manner.</p>

<p>Sadly worship today is often misunderstood or taken lightly by many professing Christians. This  has lead to countless controversies and worship being trivialised in some churches. The past year  has seen a great challenge to the gathered worship of God’s people. We need Biblical direction  and inspiration in order to rightly worship God in spirit and in truth.</p>

    <p class="speakers-bio">At age 17, God showed me mercy and gave me a new heart – I was re-born as a child of God knowing forgiveness of sins and peace with Him. The following year I went to Cambridge University to read history, majoring in the Reformation period. In these years I learned how to study the Bible, how to exegete it faithfully and how to present the gospel message to others. I began preaching in the year of my conversion at summer camps and YP meetings. In 1995 I married Alison, and after some years of preparation, we were called to the pastorate here in Ramsbottom in 1998. God has blessed us with six children, and we have made Ramsbottom our home.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">About Trinity Grace Conference</h2>

<p itemprop="description">The Trinity Grace Conference is a conference for believers aged 16-30 who are serious about  growing in their spiritual lives.</p>
    
<p>Our mission is to lead the younger generation of evangelical Christians to greater love, conviction in the faith and practical righteousness, being firmly rooted in the truths of God’s word for their  own sanctification. Thereby, to build up the next generation of church members and leaders, for the greater purity and strength of local Churches in the UK, to the glory of God.</p>

<p>We seek to fulfil these goals in the following ways:<br>

1. Through teaching the whole counsel of God as found in His holy Word and expressed in the <a href="https://www.the1689confession.com/" title="Read the 1689 London Baptist Confession">1689 London Baptist Confession of Faith</a>.<br>
2. Through addressing relevant issues for younger people in our modern society, in discussion with both young people and their pastors.<br>
3. Through endorsing godly and relevant resources, introducing young people to the rich biblical resources that will properly guide them.<br>
4. Through encouraging fellowship and the creation of friendships and connections between like-minded young people.
